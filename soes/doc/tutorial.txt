\section general General

The SOES is a library that provides the Micro Controller user application with
 the means to access the EtherCAT fieldbus communication environment:
 - EtherCAT State Machine
 - Mailbox Interfaces
 - Protocols
   - CoE
   - FoE + bootstrap template

Support for mailbox and protocols are typical examples when you need a slave
stack to control the Application Layer of EtherCAT. The PDI used for such 
applications is either SPI or some Micro Controller Interface
   
The following sections show some basic examples on how to get the SOES up
and running, as well as a lightweight example on howto design your slave. 
Since all code is local to the application or global variables, it is possible
 to tweak and optimize when possible.
 
Our target Application:
 - Inputs 40bit
  - One button  8bit
  - One encoder value 32bit
 - Outputs 8bit
  - LED 8bit
 - Parameters
  - Encoder settings
 - Slave commands
  - Reset counter
 
Now to translate and implement on top of SOES.

First look on the start up code. This example shows how to add a 
main function that will be called by startup code. In this example 
main's only purpose is to spawn two new tasks. One that executes 
SOES and one that control the ERROR LED. Some ESCs provided a pin 
for the RUN LED, some even for the ERROR LED, if it don't you can 
control them from the slave Micro Controller. We'll focus on the "soes" task. 

\code

int main (void)
{
   rprintp ("SOES (Simple Open EtherCAT Slave)\nsoes test\n");

   /* task_spawn ("led_run", led_error, 15, 512, NULL); /
   task_spawn ("led_error", led_error, 15, 512, NULL);
   task_spawn ("soes", soes, 9, 1024, NULL);

   return (0);
}

\endcode

\section configuration Configuration
The function soes is our EtherCAT slave device and can be split in 3 parts.
Hardware Init, Software Init and Application loop. We will start with the
Hardware Init.

 - Hardware Init
  - esc_reset, special function used for ESC reset if no Physical 
  EEPROM used. This is local to the Application not part of the generic
  ESC handling.
  - ESC_init, initialise SPI communication or similar
  - Wait for ESC is started, waiting for SPI to be up and running, 
  we'll query the ESC register DL status if EEPROM loaded OK and PDI
  operational, eg. SPI OK.
  
\code
  
void soes (void *arg)
{
   TXPDOsize = SM3_sml = sizeTXPDO ();
   RXPDOsize = SM2_sml = sizeRXPDO ();

   esc_reset ();
   ESC_init ((void *)spi_name);

   task_delay (tick_from_ms (200));

   // wait until ESC is started up
   while ((ESCvar.DLstatus & 0x0001) == 0)
   {
      ESC_read (ESCREG_DLSTATUS, (void *) &ESCvar.DLstatus,
                sizeof (ESCvar.DLstatus), (void *) &ESCvar.ALevent);
      ESCvar.DLstatus = etohs (ESCvar.DLstatus);
   }

   // reset ESC to init state
   ESC_ALstatus (ESCinit);
...
}

\endcode

 - Software Init 
  - Reset the slave into Init state by writing AL Status register.
  - Clear Errors by writing AL Status Code register.
  - Stop the Application Layer, basically we disable the SyncManagers 
  that implicitly block the data exchange.

\code
  
void soes (void *arg)
{
...
   while ((ESCvar.DLstatus & 0x0001) == 0)
   {
      ESC_read (ESCREG_DLSTATUS, (void *) &ESCvar.DLstatus,
                sizeof (ESCvar.DLstatus), (void *) &ESCvar.ALevent);
      ESCvar.DLstatus = etohs (ESCvar.DLstatus);
   }

   // reset ESC to init state
   ESC_ALstatus (ESCinit);
   ESC_ALerror (ALERR_NONE);
   ESC_stopmbx ();
   ESC_stopinput ();
   ESC_stopoutput ();

   // application run loop
   while (1)
...
}  
\endcode

 - Application loop
  - ALevent handling, ALevent hold information on changes in ALControl or 
  SyncManagers. ALControl for state changes and SyncManagers for changes written 
  by EtherCAT in local memory mapped to active SyncManagers
  - ESC_state for state handling, such as state step up or down with correct 
  error and acknowledge response.  
  - Mailbox handler, generic support of mailboxes used by all Application Layer
  protocols.
  - On mailbox actions we'll also check if we need to use a specific protocol 
  handler to handle the incoming or outgoing Mailbox data.

Up until the now we're using the SOES protocol stack without any application specific
calls. Next up we'll look at the application Code, here named DIG_process ().

\code
  
void soes (void *arg)
{
...
   // application run loop
   while (1)
   {
      if((ESCvar.ALstatus & 0x0f) == ESCinit)
      {
         txpdomap = DEFAULTTXPDOMAP;
         rxpdomap = DEFAULTRXPDOMAP;
         txpdoitems = DEFAULTTXPDOITEMS;
         rxpdoitems = DEFAULTTXPDOITEMS;
      }
      ESC_read (ESCREG_LOCALTIME, (void *) &ESCvar.Time, sizeof (ESCvar.Time),
                (void *) &ESCvar.ALevent);
      ESCvar.Time = etohl (ESCvar.Time);

      ESC_ALevent();

      ESC_state ();
      if (ESC_mbxprocess ())
      {
         ESC_coeprocess ();
         ESC_foeprocess ();
         ESC_xoeprocess ();
      }
      DIG_process ();
   };
}

\endcode

\section application Application
The function DIG_process is the User part of the application and could be joined
by more cyclic User functions for executing other parts of the application.
The example code can be split in 2 parts
 - Outputs
  - Start by evaluating if we're in a state supporting update of outputs, eg. 
  Operational state.
  - If we're in OP we can read the current PDO data in the 3-buffer SyncManager
  mapped to the output SM, the default is SyncManager2, we read the ESC RAM address
  of SM2 and store it at the local address of the local variable Wb.LED.
  We'll read RXPDOsize bytes to trigger a complete SyncManager read. 
  - After local variables have been refreshed we basically write the local
  PDO variables to the User application, ex. a GPIO. 
  - Basically this is the API of the SOES toward the User Application.
  - This function also include a watchdog mechanism, if triggered it will 
  shutdown the outputs and trigger a state changes to safe operational. 
  AlError is updated with cause of error to inform the Master.
  
\code

void RXPDO_update (void)
{
   ESC_read (SM2_sma, &Wb.LED, RXPDOsize, (void *) &ESCvar.ALevent);
}

void DIG_process (void)
{
   if (App.state & APPSTATE_OUTPUT)
   {
      if (ESCvar.ALevent & ESCREG_ALEVENT_SM2)  // SM2 trigger ?
      {
         RXPDO_update ();
         reset_wd ();
         gpio_set(GPIO_LED, Wb.LED & BIT(0));

      }
      if (!wd_cnt)
      {
         ESC_stopoutput ();
         // watchdog, invalid outputs
         ESC_ALerror (ALERR_WATCHDOG);
         // goto safe-op with error bit set
         ESC_ALstatus (ESCsafeop | ESCerror);
         wd_trigger = 1;
      }
   }
   else
   {
      reset_wd ();
   }
...
}

\endcode

 - Inputs
  - Is handled a bit simpler than outputs but in reverse order, the slave will 
  continue update the inputs in state Safe Operational.
  - Here we first read User application data from ex. GPIO and then write to 
  local PDO variables.
  - After the local variables have been refreshed we write those to the current
  PDO data 3-buffer SyncManager mapped to the input SM, the default is SyncManager3.
  This way we update the ESC RAM address with User Application data accessed by
  the EtherCAT master.
  
\code
  
void TXPDO_update (void)
{
   ESC_write (SM3_sma, &Rb.button, TXPDOsize, (void *) &ESCvar.ALevent);
}

void DIG_process (void)
{
...
   Rb.button = gpio_get(GPIO_WAKEUP);
   Cb.reset_counter++;
   Rb.encoder =  Cb.reset_counter;

   TXPDO_update ();
}

\endcode

\section ApplicationdataProcessdata ApplicationdataProcessdata
To run application data through EtherCAT processdata we need to describe for 
the fieldbus what data we have and will read/write. For this we have 3 objects, 
the ESI file, SII-EEPROM and CoE Object Dictionary. The first 2 are mandatory 
and the third is a very convenient way of describing complex slaves.

Our strategy is to keep the ESI file and the SII-EEPROM as thin as possible to 
avoid duplication of data that need to be maintained. Both will hold the bare 
minimum of mandatory + optional data to pass CTT. Optional data will be 
included to tell EtherCAT that detailed information can be retrieved via CoE 
from the OD stored in the slave it self.

\section SII-EEPROM SII-EEPROM

So to describe the application we use CoE and Object Dictionary. The mapping between
Object Dictionary and the User Application are done via local variables defined as 
user types. The Object Dictionary itself is stored in a matrix where all 
the indexes are listed. Every index then have a submatrix with its subindex.

\section ObjectDictionary ObjectDictionary
The Object Dictionary used as example follow the CANopen DS301 ranges. 

 - 0x0000 - 0x0FFF, Data Type Area
 - 0x1000 - 0x1FFF, Communication Area
 - 0x2000 - 0x5FFF, Manufacture specific area
 - 0x6000 - 0x6FFF, Input area
 - 0x7000 - 0x7FFF, Output area
 - 0x8000 - 0x8FFF, Configuration area
 - 0x9000 - 0x9FFF, Information area
 - 0xA000 - 0xAFFF, Diagnosis Area
 - 0xB000 - 0xBFFF, Service Transfer Area
 - 0xC000 - 0xEFFF, Reserved Area
 - 0xF000 - 0xFFFF, Device Area

RxPDO , 0x1600 - 0x17FF
TxPDO , 0x1A00 - 0x1BFF

Example, on how the the OD index are linked.
Top index, SyncManagers Communication Types. In index 0 the 0x04 indicates we have 4 
SyncManagers defined. Every SyncManager is assigned a type, in index 1-4, we have standard
settings SM0 = 1, SM1 = 2, SM2 = 3, SM3 = 4 from ETG 1000.6, 5.6.7.4.  
 - 0, Unused
 - 1, MailBox Receive, master to slave 
 - 2, MailBox Send, slave to master 
 - 3, Processdata output, master to slave
 - 4, Processdata input, slave to master

\code
objectlist.h
FLASHSTORE _objectlist SDOobjects[] =
...
  {0x1C00, OTYPE_ARRAY, 4, 0, &acName1C00[0], &SDO1C00[0]},
  
FLASHSTORE _objd SDO1C00[] =
{ {0x00, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acNameNOE[0], 0x04, nil},
  {0x01, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acName1C00_01[0], 0x01, nil},
  {0x02, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acName1C00_02[0], 0x02, nil},
  {0x03, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acName1C00_03[0], 0x03, nil},
  {0x04, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acName1C00_04[0], 0x04, nil}
  
\endcode

SyncManagers channels 0-31 are listed in SDO1C10-SDO1C2F. If we look
at SyncManager channel 2, we see.
 
 - Type 3, Processdata output, master to slave

It got one RxPDO index 0x1600 connected, and the submatrix for 0x1600 link
one PDO object index 0x7000 subindex 1. The output object 0x70000108 give 
you the index 0x7000, subindex 1 and PDO object length 1(byte).

\code
objectlist.h
FLASHSTORE _objd SDO1C12[] =
{ {0x00, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acNameNOE[0], 0x01, nil},
  {0x01, DTYPE_UNSIGNED16, 16, ATYPE_R, &acNameMO[0], 0x1600, nil}
};
  
FLASHSTORE _objd SDO1600[] =
{ {0x00, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acNameNOE[0], 0x01, nil},
  {0x01, DTYPE_UNSIGNED32, 32, ATYPE_R, &acNameMO[0], 0x70000108, nil}
};
  
\endcode

At PDO level we make the connection between the local application and
the object dictionary. For all subindex in the PDO the last element
is the address to the local variable.

\code

objectlist.h
FLASHSTORE _objd SDO7000[] =
{ {0x00, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acNameNOE[0], 0x01, nil},
  {0x01, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_RW, &acName7000_01[0], 0, &(Wb.LED)}
};

utypes.h
typedef struct
{
   uint8 LED;
} _Wbuffer;
  
\endcode

Beside SyncManager to PDO mapping we also have mandatory data as 

0x1000 Device Type
0x1018 Object Identity
0x10C0 SyncManager Communication Type, as we used as top index when 
figuring out our PDOs in the Object Dictionary.

For a complete description of the object dictionary you can get guidance
by the ETG1000.6 EcatAlProtocols

A useful feature is the Asynchronous use of SDO parameters. In the example
we have Parameter set holding an encoder scale value, just for show we also
have a read only mirror value of the encoder scale. Parameters defined as a
RW SDO parameter and can be written/read by SDO Download or Upload. In 
addition there is a ESC_objecthandler Hook on SDO Download where you can 
add additional logic, ex. we execute the mirror of the encoder scale value
by assigning the encoder scale value to the mirror.

\code

objectlist.h
FLASHSTORE _objd SDO7100[] =
{ {0x00, DTYPE_UNSIGNED8, 8, ATYPE_R, &acNameNOE[0], 0x02, nil},
  {0x01, DTYPE_UNSIGNED32, 32, ATYPE_RW, &acName7100_01[0], 0, &(encoder_scale)},
  {0x02, DTYPE_UNSIGNED32, 32, ATYPE_R, &acName7100_02[0], 0, &(encoder_scale_mirror)}
};

soes.c
void ESC_objecthandler (uint16 index, uint8 subindex)
{
   switch (index)
   {
...
      case 0x7100:
      {
         switch (subindex)
         {
            case 0x01:
            {
               encoder_scale_mirror = encoder_scale;
               break;
            }
         }
         break;
      }
...
}

\endcode
This tutorial is just one way of doing it.
Enjoy and happy coding!
